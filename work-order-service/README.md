# Work Order Service

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/HHG-HAIL/field-services)

A microservice for managing field service work orders in the Field Services platform.

## Overview

The Work Order Service is responsible for managing the complete lifecycle of work orders, from creation to completion. It provides RESTful APIs for CRUD operations, status management, assignment to technicians, and various query capabilities.

#### Relationships

- **One-to-Many**: A work order can have multiple work order items
- **Cascade Delete**: When a work order is deleted, all associated items are deleted

## Entity Relationships

WorkOrder (1) -----> (Many) WorkOrderItem
```

## Building and Running

### Prerequisites

- Java 17 or higher
- Maven 3.6+

### Build

```bash
mvn clean install
```

### Run

```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```

The service will start on port 8084 by default.

### Access H2 Console

When running locally, you can access the H2 database console at:
```
http://localhost:8084/h2-console
```

Connection details:
- JDBC URL: `jdbc:h2:mem:workorderdb`
- Username: `sa`
- Password: (empty)

## Testing

### Run All Tests

```bash
mvn test
```

### Test Coverage

The project includes:
- Unit tests for service layer
- Integration tests for repository layer
- Controller integration tests using MockMvc

## Configuration

### Application Properties

Key configuration properties in `application.yml`:

```yaml
spring:
  application:
    name: work-order-service
  datasource:
    url: jdbc:h2:mem:workorderdb
  jpa:
    hibernate:
      ddl-auto: validate
  flyway:
    enabled: true

server:
  port: 8084
```

## Database Migrations

Database migrations are managed using Flyway. Migration scripts are located in:
```
src/main/resources/db/migration/
```

Current migrations:
- `V1__create_work_order_schema.sql` - Initial schema creation

## Design Decisions

### Normalization

The schema follows third normal form (3NF) with proper separation of concerns:
- Work orders and work order items are in separate tables
- No repeating groups
- All non-key attributes depend on the primary key

### Denormalization for Performance

Some denormalization is used for performance optimization:
- Customer name, phone, and email are stored in work_orders table for quick access
- Technician name is stored alongside technician ID

### Indexing Strategy

Indexes are created on frequently queried columns:
- Status and priority for filtering
- Customer and technician IDs for relationship queries
- Dates for temporal queries

### Scalability Considerations

- Uses optimistic locking (version field) to handle concurrent updates
- Indexes on foreign keys and frequently queried fields
- Cascade delete ensures referential integrity
- H2 can be easily replaced with PostgreSQL/MySQL for production

### Future Enhancements

The schema is designed to support:
- Integration with separate Customer and Technician services
- Event-driven architecture for status changes
- Audit logging of all changes
- File attachments (photos, documents)
- Work order templates
- Recurring work orders
- Service Level Agreements (SLAs)

## Monitoring

```
GET /actuator/health
```
